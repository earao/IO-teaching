# 1. An introduction to input-output analysis 

Before we learn input-output analysis, we will start with an introduction to matrix algebra - a technique used extensively in IO

## Workbook 1: Matrix algebra using Python

If you've studied matrix algebra in your previous degree or even at high school, you might find this very straightforward.

## Input-output video 1: Introduction (15 minutes)

This video introduces the idea of accounting for emissions from a consumption rather than a production perspective.

One of the main uses of input-output analysis is to calculate consumption-based accounts.
